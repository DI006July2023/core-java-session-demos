2 steps to work with methods
-----------------------------
1) define a method
2) call/invoke the method

access specifiers
-----------------
public 
private
protected
default

access modifiers
-----------------
static
final
transient
native
synchronized
....


only a static method can call another static method
in other words i can say a static method cannot call a non static method
and that's the reason we are placing static in front of the methods that we created in the demo
however static has a different purpose and it will be discussed in the upcoming sessions
