Spring framework has many modules

Friday
Spring core
-----------
2 main concepts
	- IOC (Inversion Of Control)
	- DI (Dependency Injection)

Tuesday
How the web works?
full stack application
	- front end application
	- back end application

Wednesday
Spring MVC
----------


Spring Boot *
-----------
	- it is a RAD(Rapid Application Developement) tool

Spring Rest *
-----------
	- we use this in the backend application
	- to create Rest services

Spring JdbcTemplate *
-------------------
	- this works in DAO layer

Spring JPA(Java Persistence API) 
--------------------------------
	- this works in the DAO layer
	- ORM - Object Relational Mapping
	- this would be the next level of Spring JDBCTemplate
	- this is spring's ORM framework with default implementation of Hibernation

front end - HTML, CSS(Bootstrap) , Javascript
back end(main focus) - Spring Boot, Spring Rest, Spring JdbcTemplate

How web application works
--------------------------

Web server - hosts web applications
web application - collection of web pages
web pages
	- 2 types
		- static web pages
			- contents reamin the same on the server side
			- html(Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS(Cascading Stylesheet), Javascript(scripting language)
			- here we need static web servers
		- dynamic web pages
			- contents change on the server side, depending on the inputs of the previuos page
			- has to be processed on the server side and the contents are decided on the server side itself
			- so obvously the server should be capable of processing the page
			- and for this we need a dynamic web server
			- servlets and JSP(Java Server Pages) - we will not learn this

server side programming
	- servlets, JSP
client side programming
	- Javascript

Javascript
	- animations
	- validate the inputs in the form before submitting to server
	- manipulate the DOM(Document Object Model) Tree


backend  application
---------------------
	- this is where we create/expose endpoints
	- these endpoints provide resources to the front end application/ to other back end application
	- interacts with the DB through DAO layer
	- frameworks like NodeJS/ExpressJS, Spring Rest framework can be used to create the backend application
	- we use Postman to test the endpoints of the backend application

frontend application
--------------------
	- represents the view of the project
	- has the capability to manipulate the DOM with Javascript
	- contacts the backend application for resources
	- the front end and the back end exchange data.
	- This data could be in different formats like XML, JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)
	- angular is a framework that can be used for developing front end application
	- reactjs is a library that can be used for developing front end application

MERN developer 
	M - Mongo DB
	E - Express JS
	R - ReactJs
	N - Node JS

MEAN developer
	M - Mongo DB
	E - Express JS
	A - Angular
	N - Node JS


when we request for a resource from the backend - 4 types of request

Get request - Read

Post Request - Create

Put Request - Update

Delete Request - Delete


every request and response has
	- a header
	- body
postman
	- a tool/client to test endpoints

Swagger
	- similar to postman 
	- used to test endpoints
