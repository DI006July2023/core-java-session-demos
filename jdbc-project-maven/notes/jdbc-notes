pre-requisite
-------------
make sure to include the driver jar file in the dependency list of pom.xml

steps for JDBC(Java DataBase Connectivity)
------------------------------------------
1) Load the driver (into memory)
	Class.forName("<fully qualified name of the class>");
2) Establish connection to the Database server
	Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("<connection url has the ipadress, port, protocol>","<username>","<password>");
3) Create a Statement and execute it
	String query = "DELETE * FROM employee_details WHERE emp_id=501";
	Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
	int rowsAffected = stmt.executeUpdate(query); ----> in this line the query goed to the DB server, gets compiled and executed 
								and the result is sent back to the java program
								which is received in rowsAffected					
4) Handle the exceptions
5) Close the connection
	conn.close();



4 things a client should know to contact the server
---------------------------------------------------
1) IP Address of the server 
2) port number in which the server is running
3) protocol
4) credentials

3 types of execute methods of Statement
--------------------------------------
boolean status = stmt.execute(query); -----> DDL
int rowsAffected = stmt.executeUpdate(query); -----> DML
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query); -----> DQL
