spring-core configuration can be done in 3 ways
-----------------------------------------------
1) xml based configuration
	- here we have an xml file
	- the beans are configured in this xml file
	- we refer to this xml file while creating the spring core container
		ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("anyname.xml");
	
2) annotation based configuration
	- here there is no need of the xml file
	- all classes annotated with @Component is configured as a bean
	- the spring core container is created 
			AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
			context.scan("springcoreannotationbased");
			context.refresh();
	- @Component, @Value, @Autowired

3) java based configuration
