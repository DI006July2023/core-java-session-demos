steps done in todays(7th Aug) session
-------------------------------------
1) create a remote repository in our github account , we created a remote repository called git-trial
2) create a working diretory in your local computer, a working directory is just a folder in your local computer, we created git-practise
3) create some files in the working directory like sample.txt
4) create the local repository in your working directory, 
	- for this open git bash in your working directory, 
	- git bash is a terminal where you can type your git commands
	- run the command
		- git init
5) a hidden folder in the name .git is created. This .git folder is my local repository
	- deleting the .git folder is like deleting the local repository

6) configure git user name and email - refer engage
7) git config --list
	- this command list all the git configuraion
8) add all the files from working directory to the staging
	- git add .
9) commit the files to the local repository
	- git commit -m "first commit"
10) change the branch name from master to main in local repo
	- git branch -M main
11) set the remote repository to which we will push the code in step 12
	- git remote add origin https://github.com/DI006July2023/git-trial.git
12) push the code to the remote repository
	- git push -u origin main

other ways in which you can run your git commands
	- gitbash
		- it is a unix/linux terminal
		- here we type the git commands
		- we get git bash when we install git in our local computer
	- github desktop
		- here we don't type the command, we click buttons and the work is done
	- ide plugins
		- here git plugins are installed in the IDE
		- and files are pushed and pulled directly from the IDE
	- sourcetree
		- used extensively in projects
		- helps to have a visual idea of the branches and repos created
