AWS service to deploy complete full stack application
----------------------------------------------------
front end - s3 bucket service
backend - ec2 instance
db server - RDS service


Steps to get started with developing a full stack application
-------------------------------------------------------------
Database
--------
1) normalize the table.
2) find out the relation between the entities 
	- one to one
	- one to many / many to one
	- many to many
3) prepare the ERD 
4) prepare the script file (.sql)
5) execute the script file to get the tables created with sample data in it

Backend application
-------------------
1) identify the user stories (the user stories generally translate to one or more methods)
2) identify the DTOs ( mostly the DTOs correspond to the tables in the DB)
3) create the project skeleton
	- create the DTOs
	- finish the dao package
	- finish the service package
	- finish the controller package
	- finish the exception package
4) we can start filling the code in all the layers starting from dao, then service, then controller
5) by doing this the endpoints of your backend application is ready
6) finish the unit tests for the service and the dao layer
7) use post man to check if all the endpoints are working

Frontend application
---------------------
1) design the wireframes ( sample of how the view(page) looks like)
2) create web pages
3) include the necessary links for bootstrap in the pages
4) use javascript
	- to manipulate the DOM
	- use fetch api to consume the endpoints exposed by the backend application
	- can be used for form validation on client side

run the application
-------------------
1) make sure the DB server is up and running
	- in windows i would check in the services
2) start the backend application which is the spring boot application
	- run the class which has the main method
	- as a result the tomcat server starts up
3) start the front end application 
	- in vscode , right click the html page and select open with live server
	- as a result the live server starts up
4) from the browser request the first page of your front end application

notes taken during standup meets
--------------------------------
 - the dto of the backend should correspond to the Javascript objects used in front end
 - code has to pushed to remote repository to see the changes in the remote repository.
 - a comit only comits the changes to the local repository and not the remote repository.
 - front end never interacts with the DB
